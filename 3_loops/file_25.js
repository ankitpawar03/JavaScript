//do while loop
// let i = 0;

// while (i<=10) {
//     console.log(i);
//     i++;
// }
// this is the syntax of while loop

// do while loop is similar to while loop but the difference is that in do while loop the code is executed first and then the condition is checked

// do while loop example

let j = 10;

do{
    console.log(j);
    j++;
}
while(j<=10);
