//while loop

//while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true and the condition is checked before executing the block of code so if the condition is false then the block of code will not be executed even once

//syntax: while(condition){
     
        //block of code 
    
     //}

//example:  print numbers from 1 to 10

let i = 1;

while(i <= 10){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
    // i++ is same as i = i + 1 or i += 1   it is used to increment the value of i by 1
}
