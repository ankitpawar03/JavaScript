// while loop example

let total = 0;

let i = 1;

while(i <= 100){
    total += i;
    i++;
}

console.log(total); // this will print 0 because the condition is false and the block of code is not executed even once

let n = 100;

let total2 = (n*(n+1))/2;

console.log(total2); // this will print 5050 because the formula is used to calculate the sum of first n natural numbers
